1. ### Title

   Is political power a major factor of racial disparities in police stops?

2. ### Abstract 

   Recently, there are many researches assessing the racial disparities in policing in the United States, revealing the unfair treatment the minority drivers have faced. The reasons for such phenomenon might be various: racial discrimination, finance, crime rate, political power, etc. In this project, we will draw attention to political power and test its role in racial disparities. Specifically, we will first measure the political power of a group through its presence, voice and representation in politics. Through factor analysis (comment 1) we evaluate the political power quantitatively. Then by comparing stop/search rates with regard to the political power(comment 2), we expect to find evidence that political power has a significant influence on police’s behavior. Finally, we expect to find that after Obama won the election in 2014 and became the president of America, the inequalities in policing reduced a lot. / Finally, we compare black group with Asian group (comment 3). Our results indicate that political power plays an important role in the racial disparities in policing.

   comment 1: 此处应为 衡量政治力量所用的方法，如factor analysis等

   comment 2: 此处应为 分析political power与racial disparities相关性用到的方法 

   comment 3: 第三个小任务，选择分析obama上台的影响，或者比较一下黑人和黄种人群体在traffic stop和political power上的差异。（两者选一个）

3. ### Research Questions

   (1)     How to measure the political power of a group?
   (2)     To what extent does the political power affect racial disparities in traffic stops?
   (3)     How did the election of President Obama impact the racial disparities in traffic stops?

4. ### Proposed dataset 

   We mainly use the dataset released by the original paper, available at [https://openpolicing.stanford.edu.*](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu.) Moreover, we measure the political power by three aspects: 1) percentage of the population that is black; 2) percentage of the voting population that is black; and 3) percentage of the local elected government that is black. 

5. ### Methods

   In this part, we plan to use methods, like factor analysis, regression analysis, etc.

   Through factor analysis, we evaluate the political power quantitatively. Factor analysis is to use a few potential variables to explain the complex relationships that exist in observable variables. In other words, factor analysis breaks down each original (observable) variable into two parts, one of which consists of a few common factors shared by all variables; The other part is the so-called special factor part, which is the existence of a special factor that distinguishes a variable from other variables.

   There are many methods of factor extraction, most of which is principal component analysis(PCA). There are also other methods, such as the least Squares, Maximum Likelihood, Alpha Factoring, Image factoring, etc. In the future, we will consider the characteristic of our dataset, to test and choose the proper method. 

6. ### Proposed timeline

   *First week*: gather all needed data and understand them, and revise our objectives / methods if necessary depending on the data.

   *Second week*: utilize the methods mentioned before to analyze the data, change our methods if necessary. Analyze the results. Doing more experiments and analysis if necessary.

   *Third week*: at the end of this week we need to submit our report; creating and furnishing our plots / tables, and finish our report.

   *Final week*: make a video introducing our work.

7. ### Organization within the team

   * Screen and choose data from different states or cities
   * Understand and analyze the chosen dataset
   * Promote different hypothetical arguments
   * According to several hypotheses above, propose a feasible model to verify
   * Implement our model
   * Conduct the analysis and summary of our model
   * Reflection and correction
   * Sum it up into an article

8. ### Questions for TAs (optional)

   TBD
